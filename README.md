GeoPin
--------------------------
This project is for web developers that don't want to pay for IP-to-location services and would prefer to set it up (easily) on their on SQL server.  Attached in the "sql.rar" file are all related scripts to create the (3) tables and all of their data, along with the one function and one stored procedure needed.  The function and stored procedures in the rar archive are within subfolders to ensure you execute them in the correct areas on your database. =)


***CAUTION: Once these queries are executed against your server, you database size will grow by ~100MB.
