No problem!\r\n\r\nThis project gives you everything you need to setup your MS SQL server-- and all of the data as well.  Please see the attached code samples (available in both VB.Net and C#) for implementation.  It's really quite simple and will save you a ton of time and money.\r\n\r\nComing soon: a add-on that allows for calculation of distance (as the bird flies) between the user's location and another (dynamic) location."}
